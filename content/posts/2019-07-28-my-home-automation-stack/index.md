So I've been intrigued with Home Automation and Smart Homes for a while. And yes there is a difference.  Smart Homes allow you to turn on and off appliances with an app on your phone or using your voice (Google, Amazon Alexa) or a wall mounted control of some sort.  Home Automation on the otherhand is a Smart Home that does all that without your constant input, getting info and responding to it automatically

I'll go through my current setup, but it will be broken into multiple parts so to avoid information overload.
